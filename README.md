# RAG-model-to-Access-Helpline-Numbers
This Project aims in using RAG to efficiently access helpline numbers for users . As there are a lot of helpline numbers available , as users , during the times of turmoil , we may not be able to access the right helpline when needed. This is the motive behind this project , to make helpline numbers more accessible , by giving simple user  prompts.
